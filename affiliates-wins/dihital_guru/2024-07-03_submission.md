# Referral Success Story
## What I Did
I ran a targeted social media campaign and partnered with micro-influencers in the productivity niche.
## My Referral Message
"Overwhelmed with your to-do list? This tool helped me reclaim 2 hours a day. Swipe up to transform your productivity!"
## What Worked Best
The authentic testimonials from micro-influencers resonated well with their engaged audiences.
## Challenges and Lessons
Some influencer partnerships didn't yield expected results. I learned to thoroughly vet influencers and align on expectations beforehand.
## My Top Tip
Focus on building genuine relationships with influencers in your niche, not just one-off promotions.
## Additional Notes
I'm considering creating a podcast to further establish authority in the productivity space.
