# Referral Success Story
## What I Did
I engaged in daily LinkedIn networking and hosted weekly Twitter chats on productivity topics.
## My Referral Message
"Struggling to manage your team's workflow? This tool increased our team's efficiency by 40%. DM for a free trial!"
## What Worked Best
The Twitter chats created a community around productivity topics and positioned our product as a go-to solution.
## Challenges and Lessons
Consistent engagement on LinkedIn was time-consuming. I developed a content calendar to stay organized and consistent.
## My Top Tip
Don't just promote. Engage in meaningful conversations and become a trusted advisor in your niche.
## Additional Notes
I'm considering starting a LinkedIn newsletter to further nurture my professional network.
